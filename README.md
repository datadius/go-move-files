Plan is to have a client/server architecture where the TUI is bubbletea.

The user will have a command to send data, that will open the TUI to illustrate the process of data being uploaded.

The user will have a command to receive the data, where a TUI will open to illustrate the process of receiving the data.

The first middleware will handle setting up the upload.

The second middleware will handle the TUI.

Another idea would be to have the current setup as the server and create a client version that connects and the TUI server illustrates what is being done with the data.
